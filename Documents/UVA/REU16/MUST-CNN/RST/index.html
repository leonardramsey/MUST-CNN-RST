      <h3>Introduction</h3> 

      <p>This is the Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank
      Publication, produced by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog
      number LDC2002T07 and isbn 21-58563-223-6.

      <p>RST Discourse Treebank contains a selection of 385 Wall Street Journal
      articles from the <a href =
      "http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/LDC95T7.html"
      STYLE="text-decoration:none">Penn Treebank</a> which have been annotated
      with discourse structure in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory
      (RST). In addition, the corpus includes a number of humanly-generated
      extracts and abstracts associated with the original documents.

      <h3>Data Format</h3> 

      <p>The original filenames and directory structure were retained at the
         suggestion of the authors.
