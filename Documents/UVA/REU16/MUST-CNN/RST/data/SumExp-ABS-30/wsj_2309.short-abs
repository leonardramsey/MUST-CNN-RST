    Canadian Utilities plans to build electric power generating plants in 
Great Britain. These projects could cost up to one billion Canadian dollars. 
The company's decision was prompted by Great Britain's plans to privatize its 
water and electric utilities. Other companies are also considering similar 
power generating projects.
