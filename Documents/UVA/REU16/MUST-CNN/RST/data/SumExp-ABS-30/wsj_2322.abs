    Traditional Industries will seek financing alternatives after projecting 
a net loss for the fourth quarter. The company also plans to file a delayed 
fiscal report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The delay is the 
result of efforts to reach a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission 
over questionable sales practices.  As a result of the settlement, 
Traditional will set up a $250,000 trust fund for refunds to certain 
customers.
