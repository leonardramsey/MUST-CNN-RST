    The De Beers Company diamond dig, located in the Namibian desert, is one 
of the world's most lucrative. Operations last year produced 934,242 carats, 
most of them gem quality. The restricted mining area is one of the most 
desolate locations in Africa but the mine headquarters at Oranjemund boasts 
numerous amenities.
