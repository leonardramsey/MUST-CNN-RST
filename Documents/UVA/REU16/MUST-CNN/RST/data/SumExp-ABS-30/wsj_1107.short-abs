    One respondent to George Melloan's column on the problems of the housing 
market suggested that financial incentives would encourage buyers of 
foreclosed properties to remain in those properties. Another writer blames 
the FHA, VA and HUD for adding to the problem by buying properties at 
inflated prices. These properties deteriorate and attract only marginal 
buyers.
