    The bond market rose slightly yesterday after a stock market sell-off and 
forecasts of a weakening economy. In bond sales and trading, mortgage-backed 
and investment grade corporate bonds rose and municipals were mixed. 
Thirty-year treasury bonds were up 1/8 to 1/2 in light trading and high yield, 
high-risk corporate securities were unchanged.  Analysts have mixed views 
about tomorrow's first ever bond auction by the Resolution Funding 
Corporation.
