    A 6% rise in short interest in NASDAQ over the counter stocks by October 
is the largest rise since a 6.3% rise in April. Short interest can result 
from short selling or can occur during takeover situations. Short interest 
may not be a good indicator for stocks but short selling is not necessarily 
bad for the market.  Meritor Savings had the biggest short interest position 
during the September-October time frame.
