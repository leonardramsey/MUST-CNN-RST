FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery,

 There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows

 Week by week on Mancuso FBI

he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene 
5017

21
-- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI.
20
interpretation-s-e

22
 Over the first few weeks, Mancuso FBI has sprung straight from the headlines, 
5018
span

23
which is either a commendable stab at topicality, or a lack of imagination, or both.
22
interpretation-s

24
 The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate

accused of womanizing

Mancuso is called in to investigate.

 Last week, a young black girl claimed

she had been raped by a white police officer

 In this week's show, there's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility 
5026

34
 Along the way, we're introduced to the supporting cast: 
5037
span

35
a blond bombshell secretary 
5030
span

36
(Randi Brazen 
5031
span

37

comment-e

38
a scheming young boss

40
another blonde bombshell

who's also an idealistic lawyer

5034
elaboration-general-specific-e

43
and a forensics expert

44
(Charles Siebert).
43
elaboration-general-specific-e

45
 If all of this seems a little stale, 
46
antithesis

46
it's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists: 
5040
span

47
The usual suspects are found to be guilty, then not guilty, then guilty 
5041
span

48
-- but of a different crime. 
47
antithesis

49
(In last week's rape case, for example, the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest, 
5044
List

50
and the biggest villains are the politicians 
5043
span

51
who exploit the case.) 
50
elaboration-object-attribute-e

52
Most of all though, the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso.
5046
span

53
 What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism

57
 He wasn't protecting the Freedom Marchers;

he was tailing them as subversives.

 Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover,

 At the core of Mr. Loggia's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence.

67
 He describes a reporter as Miss First Amendment.

 He describes a drowned corpse as Esther Williams.

73
 Yet for all his cynicism, he's at heart a closet idealist, a softy with a secret crush on truth, justice and the American Way.

 He's the kind of guy

 If Mancuso FBI has an intriguing central character,

it also has a major flaw:
