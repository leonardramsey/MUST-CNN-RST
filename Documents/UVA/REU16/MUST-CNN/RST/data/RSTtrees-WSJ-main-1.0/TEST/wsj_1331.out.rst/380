 After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.
5043
span

3
 The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street 
5003
span

4
because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability 
5002
span

5
to convince a jury of allegations 
5001
span

6
stemming from its insider-trading investigations.
5
consequence-n-e

7
 In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986.
5010
span

8
 The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief 
5007
span

9
who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky, 
5008
Sequence

10
and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.
5008
Sequence

11
 The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian.
5176
List

12
 Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing.
5176
List

13
 But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived.
5019
span

14
 The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks 
5014
span

15
when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found 
16

16
that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document.
5015
span

17
 After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said 
18
attribution

18
they were hopelessly deadlocked, 
5016
span

19
and another mistrial was declared on March 22. 
5017
span

20
 Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June.
5022
Sequence

21
 A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge 
5021

22
who praised him

for helping the government.

 In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts.

 Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players

27
 The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo.

28
 For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.

 GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count.

to prevent a trial,

 but by the end of the month the talks had ended.

 There is much speculation among attorneys

that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman.

 Neither testified at the previous trials.

56
 The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants

virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties
