of updating prosecutorial guidelines,

 The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers.

They argue

that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties

 The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors 
5027
span

28
that they should seek to seize assets from defendants in proportion to the nature of the alleged offense,

Mr. Runkel said.

 That means that 
5032

31
if the offense deals with one part of the business, 
5031

32
you don't attempt to seize the whole business;

related to the crime,

 In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures

if there are less intrusive means

of protecting assets
