    Franco Zeffirelli's production of La Traviata at the Metropolitan Opera 
House featured lackluster performances by singers Edita Gruberova and Neil 
Shicoff. There were also numerous problems with the set. The Met has been 
able to count on Zeffirelli's productions regardless of the cast. The New 
York City Opera, by contrast, has had to cancel its season due to a labor 
dispute.
