Sears, Roebuck and Company reported significant third quarter losses despite 
the "everyday low pricing" plan that was designed to boost sales. Sears will 
continue the pricing plan but the company will use some additional sales 
strategies, including special sales and deferred billing. Total revenue for 
Sears was up by 4.8 percent for the quarter.
