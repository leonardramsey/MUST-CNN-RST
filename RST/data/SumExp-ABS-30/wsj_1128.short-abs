    The Fuji apple may one day replace the Red Delicious as the number one 
U.S. apple.  Since the Red Delicious has been over-planted and prices have 
dropped to new lows, the apple industry seems ready for change.  Along with 
growers, supermarkets are also trying different varieties of apples. Although 
the Fuji is smaller and not as perfectly shaped as the Red Delicious, it is 
much sweeter, less mealy and has a longer shelf life.
