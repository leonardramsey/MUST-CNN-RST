    The Norfolk Southern Corporation has been authorized to buy back up to 45 
million of its shares.  The purchase will be financed with available cash, 
borrowed funds and future earnings. Although the buy-back will not affect 
short-term earnings, it will reduce the number of outstanding shares and 
should increase long-term earnings.
