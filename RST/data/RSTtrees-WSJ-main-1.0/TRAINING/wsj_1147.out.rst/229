 The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance,
5005
Contrast

6
 but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
5005

 By a lopsided 401-18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort

8
to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes

the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion

 unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress.
5011
Otherwise

13
 The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991,

Mr. Panetta demanded

 His prominent role put him in the awkward position

 to assist in the recovery from Hugo,
5030

33
 bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $4 billion in unanticipated spending.
5031
interpretation-s

34
 Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman,
35
result

35
 the immediate impact is relatively small.
5034

36
 But the appropriations set in motion spending
5036

37
 that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991.
36
elaboration-object-attribute-e

38
 Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult
5038

39
 since the costs will be counted against the share of funds

 The hastily drafted measure could hurt California

 by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance

 And the state's delegation is fearful

 Also, the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations

 For example, disaster loans,

 Administration pressure discourages any effort
