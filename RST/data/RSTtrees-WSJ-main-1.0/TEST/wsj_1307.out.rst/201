 In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining 
5001
span

2
that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.
1
cause

3
 David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset 
5003
span

4
that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration 
5004
span

5
suggesting 
5006
attribution

6
that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup 
5006
span

7
that might result in his assassination. 
6
elaboration-object-attribute-e

8
 With due respect to highly classified correspondence and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.
5009
span

9
 If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, 
10
circumstance

10
the American people ought to know. 
5008
span

11
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.
5008
elaboration-additional

12
 Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein 
5012
span

13
to blame the executive branch 
12
purpose

14
while stamping top secret on their own complicity.
5012
temporal-same-time

15
 But there's no danger 
5015
span

16
of exposing sources and methods 
15
elaboration-object-attribute

17
in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.

if Congress is going to assume authority 
5020
span

to micromanage foreign policy,

21
it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too.
5099

22
 The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega. 
5022
span

23
When they did, 
5024
temporal-same-time

24
his commanders didn't have the initiative 
5024
span

25
to do more than block a couple of roads.
24
elaboration-object-attribute-e

26
 The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity.
5026
span

27
 But what kind of initiative can you expect 
5027
span

28
given the climate set by Congress?
27
circumstance

29
 For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?
5029
span

30
 What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness 
5030
span

31
to pull the trigger 
30
elaboration-object-attribute-e

32
when he had General Noriega in custody, 
5032
span

33
but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops?
32
antithesis

34
 Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation 
5034
span

35
once he had the pistol. 
34
condition

36
Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: 
5036
span

37
You have the right 
5037
span

38
to conceal your coup intentions, 
37
elaboration-object-attribute-e

39
because we may rat on you.
5037
reason

40
 Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: 
5040
span

41
Confiding in the United States may be fatal.
40
restatement

42
 CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week 
5042
span

43
by noting 
5045
span

44
that the executive order 
5043
span

45
banning assassinations 
44
elaboration-object-attribute

46
had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.
5044
Same-Unit

47
 The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, 
5047
span

48
but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point.
5048
span

49
 The interpretation of the executive order, 
5049
span

50
Mr. Stoltz said,

attribution

51
and the way 
5051
span

52
in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, 
51
elaboration-object-attribute

53
has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, 
5052
span

54
including me. 
53
elaboration-part-whole

55
In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, 
5054
List

56
and that's fine with the CIA.
5055
span

57
 The pay's the same, 
5056
List

58
and the duty's lighter.
5056
List

59
 And of course, doing anything 
5058
span

60
that might be second-guessed by Congress 
59
elaboration-object-attribute

61
carries heavy penalties.
5060
span

62
 Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.
5061
span

63
 The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell 
5062
span

64
to write a best seller about Iran-Contra, 
5063
span

65
deploring Men of Zeal.
64
elaboration-object-attribute

66
 No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.
5065
span

67
 What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line 
5066
span

68
who've read all this 
5067
List

69
and know what can happen 
5068
span

70
if they fail?
69
condition

71
 Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play?
5066
comment

72
 The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.
5071
span

73
 President Bush would do himself and the country a favor 
5072
span

74
by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability 
5073
span

75
to defend America's national security.
74
elaboration-object-attribute-e

76
 There are of course good reasons 
5075
span

77
the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, 
76
elaboration-object-attribute

78
but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing 
5077
span

79
as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.
78
comparison

80
 The world being the nasty place 
5079
span

81
it is, 
80
elaboration-object-attribute

82
we want Presidents to have the freedom 
5082
span

83
to order operations 
5083
span

84
in which someone might get killed. 
83
elaboration-object-attribute-e

85
In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance, 
5086
concession

86
you can only make sure 
5086
span

87
the President takes the responsibility.
86
enablement

88
 The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.
5088
span

89
 As it now stands, 
5089
span

90
the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, 
5090
Contrast

91
but can't assassinate Colonel Gadhafi.
5090
Contrast

92
 It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, 
5092
Contrast

93
but can't shoot Abu Nidal. 
5092
Contrast

94
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world 
5094
span

95
that the only way 
5095
span

96
the U.S. will kill a madman 
95
elaboration-object-attribute

is by making sure 
5097

98
we take some innocent civilians with him.
