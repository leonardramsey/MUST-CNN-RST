 The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire 
5004
span

6
to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products.
5
elaboration-object-attribute-e

7
 But it would allow considerable flexibility 
5005
span

8
in determining how and when these goals would be achieved.

 The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade 
5008
span

10
by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs 
5007
span

11
that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.

 Mr. Yeutter,

that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000,

20
 said

21
the new U.S. proposal wouldn't put farmers out of business

but would only encourage them to grow what the markets desire

 The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva,

26
 that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules

 Another U.S. proposal

 filed Monday

urges more fair play in services trade,

32
 Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal
5036

33
 which struck European countries as too extreme,

 the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver.

 For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear
5034
attribution

36
 there would be a transition period
5034

37
 during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas 
5033

38
to cushion their farmers from foreign competition.

 It also says

attribution

40
countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products

condition

42
 Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies,
5044
span

43
 as the earlier U.S. proposal did,
42
background

44
 the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.
5045
span

45
 Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints,
5046

46
 and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions.

 The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures

48
 to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules
5062

49
 to impede trade arbitrarily.

purpose

 The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one

 to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle.
